I am a <span class="text-highlight">Sheffield</span> graduate with a passion for making videogames and a first class degree in <span class="text-highlight">Computer Science</span>. I enjoy playing videogames of all kinds of genres, but am a particular fan of Sackboy: A Big Adventure for PS5.

I enjoy spending time outdoors, and am a keen rock climber and open-water swimmer in my free time. 

I have taken part in numerous game jams and team development projects and I believe that my ability to <span class="text-highlight">learn</span> and <span class="text-highlight">communicate</span> technical information makes me an asset to game teams. <span class="text-highlight">I enjoy working with other creative disciplines</span> and relish the creative partnerships in gamedev. I enjoy <span class="text-highlight">solving technical problems</span> in <span class="text-highlight">creative</span> ways and love to <span class="text-highlight">learn new things</span>, so I would particularly appreciate the opportunity to work in the ever-changing technological landscape of the video game industry.
