Any employer would expect you to express interest in the industry/company you are applying to join, but this is especially true in games where there is significant competition. That doesn’t mean that everyone who works in the industry must be a die-hard gamer, but you do need to be excited about applying your technical skills to creative projects. It isn’t enough to just love playing games.

Your portfolio should showcase your most up to date knowledge and skills, and not everything you have ever done. Curate your best three pieces of work and throw out anything that isn’t your latest best work. Employers will probably only have time to look at one or two pieces of work so make sure they can find your best work immediately.
